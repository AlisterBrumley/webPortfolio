            communication and teamwork in 12+ member teams, with a key focus being communica-tion and maintaining
            quality. I run a
            small home network setup which has allowed me to develop skills in scripting and system administration and

            learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript development. I’m looking for entry level roles, to learn industry skills, and
            contribute to
            a team.
